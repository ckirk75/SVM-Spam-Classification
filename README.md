SVM Spam Classification
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classifying email messages as either spam or non-spam. The goal is to develop a robust machine learning pipeline to identify spam emails with high accuracy.

Key Features
Implements SVM for binary classification.
Preprocessing of email text data using NLP techniques (e.g., tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization).
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset of labeled email messages, typically containing:

Spam: Messages that are unsolicited and irrelevant.
Non-Spam (Ham): Legitimate messages.

Results
Evaluation Metrics
Confusion Matrix

Technologies and Libraries
Python: Programming language for implementation.
scikit-learn: For SVM, preprocessing, and evaluation.
pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical computations.
matplotlib/seaborn: For data visualization.
